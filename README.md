## Overview

This project provides a distributed task orchestration system for submitting and managing PyTorch training jobs using OpenStack-style architecture with Oslo Messaging and SQLAlchemy.


## TODO:
* Authentication via Keystone maybe?
* Task submission and task management
* Telemetry
* Filters?
* Work from the API layer to pass context around
* Logging?
